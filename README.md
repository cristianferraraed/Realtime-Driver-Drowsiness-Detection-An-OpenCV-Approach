# Project Information

This project aims to develop a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV. The system will monitor a driver's face and detect signs of drowsiness, such as blinking or yawning, to enhance road safety by alerting the driver if signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Objectives:
1. Face Detection:
	- Use OpenCV to detect the driver's face in real-time using Haar Cascades or a pre-trained deep learning model.
2. Eye and Yawn Detection:
	- Detect eye blinks and yawns to assess drowsiness levels. This can be achieved using facial landmarks to analyze eye and mouth regions.
3. Real-Time Alerts:
	- Implement a system to provide alerts (visual or auditory) when drowsiness is detected to help the driver stay alert.
